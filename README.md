This is a speed test for languages.

## Dependincies

- hyperfine: for benchmark
- gfortran: for compile fortran
- cobc: for compile cobol
- nasm: for creating `.o` file of x86_64 assembly 
- gcc and clang: for compile C
- g++ and clang++: for compile c++
- go: for compile go
- javac and java: for compile and run java
- v: for compile v

(for now) interpreted languages aren't in the test but I'll include them soon!
